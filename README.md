## [Project 1: Movie Recommendation System Model]

Overview: This project focuses on building a movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. It uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering methods to enhance the user experience by delivering personalized movie suggestions.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Utilized a dataset containing user ratings and movie information, cleaned it, and prepared it for model training.
Collaborative Filtering: Implemented using the user-item interaction matrix and matrix factorization (SVD) to predict user ratings for unrated movies.
Content-Based Filtering: Leveraged movie metadata (genre, director, cast, etc.) to recommend similar movies based on a user's viewing history.
Hybrid Approach: Combined collaborative and content-based filtering to improve recommendation accuracy.
Evaluation Metrics: Assessed model performance using RMSE for rating predictions and precision/recall for recommendation quality.
Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Surprise library, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.

Outcome: The system successfully provided personalized movie recommendations, significantly improving recommendation accuracy compared to baseline models.
