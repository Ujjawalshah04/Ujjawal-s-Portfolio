## Some of the projects made by me

## [Project 1: Movie Recommendation System Model]

Overview: This project focuses on building a movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. It uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering methods to enhance the user experience by delivering personalized movie suggestions.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Utilized a dataset containing user ratings and movie information, cleaned it, and prepared it for model training.
Collaborative Filtering: Implemented using the user-item interaction matrix and matrix factorization (SVD) to predict user ratings for unrated movies.
Content-Based Filtering: Leveraged movie metadata (genre, director, cast, etc.) to recommend similar movies based on a user's viewing history.
Hybrid Approach: Combined collaborative and content-based filtering to improve recommendation accuracy.
Evaluation Metrics: Assessed model performance using RMSE for rating predictions and precision/recall for recommendation quality.
Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Surprise library, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.

Outcome: The system successfully provided personalized movie recommendations, significantly improving recommendation accuracy compared to baseline models.

## [Project 2: Zomato Data Analysis Project]

Overview: This project involves analyzing Zomato’s customer and restaurant data to derive insights that can enhance business decisions. The analysis focuses on understanding customer behavior, restaurant popularity, and the impact of different order modes on ratings. The project showcases data exploration, visualization, and insights generation.

Key Objectives:

Restaurant Preferences: Analyzed the types of restaurants that customers frequently order from.
Customer Voting Behavior: Investigated how many votes each restaurant type received to identify customer engagement trends.
Restaurant Ratings: Examined the distribution of restaurant ratings to find out what ratings most restaurants received.
Couple Spending Habits: Analyzed the average spending per order among couples, who are identified as key users of Zomato’s food delivery services.
Mode-based Ratings: Compared the ratings received by online versus offline orders to determine which mode received higher customer satisfaction.
Offline Order Trends: Identified the types of restaurants receiving more offline orders, helping Zomato target these customers with promotional offers.
Key Insights:

Majority of customers prefer a specific type of restaurant, which can help Zomato optimize partnerships.
Detailed voting and rating trends assist in understanding customer satisfaction and restaurant performance.
Insights into couple ordering habits provide targeted marketing opportunities.
The comparison between online and offline order ratings offers actionable feedback for service improvements.
Tools & Technologies:
Python: Used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.
Pandas & NumPy: Handled data manipulation and aggregation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Created visualizations to represent key findings.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted in-depth analysis to extract meaningful insights.

Outcome: This project delivered valuable insights into customer behavior, restaurant performance, and the impact of ordering modes, enabling data-driven decision-making for Zomato’s business strategies.
